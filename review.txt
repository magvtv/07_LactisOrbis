# sparks about Planet Yogurt
1 to make it a trusted froyo chain in east africa. start small - just in kenya.

there are many things that are going on in my head about this new planet yogurt website. 

first of all i do not only want to be the one designing for them the website, God willing i want to also have a part in the company high table. say something like the one behind the software of the company. that is a good start for me i would say. 

# order online
this would be a soon to come feature. because it is not there yet as i write this and there is no need for forcing issues. i do have hopes there will be one. 
idea => having special planet yogurt bikes with back fridges to maintain the temperatures of the froyo that not melting. not really the bikes you know, just the carrier package itself when being delivered.

# ordering online is possible, now the delivery
there is a good idea from LLaoLLao on how to do what i thought about having a fridge compatment. maybe redesigning the bikes and making it more innovative to the ones delivering it.

# flavors and toppings
for a page? not yet started. 
have the base ones, then keep constantly innovating and developing new ones to keep them coming. 

treats that planet yogurt can also touch on are:
    frozen yogurt
    smoothies / shakes

maybe something out of the box, like an all in one and have it be called a certain name. party box? word play a bit to the flavors you know... how does that sound. 



# find a planet - find a store
this talks more into the real estate locations. 
it is more of that creative outlook to venture into collage campuses, cinemas, resorts, travel plazas


# features to add on the way... later on God willing and hopefully 
1 catering services 
2 gift cards (reward systems to consumers). design can be a majorly black card with finishes of green and pink writing to the client's name. or rather, not making the physical but virtual cards. that makes sense - it does. 
3 have a main planet yogurt. 
4 about that franchising - way to expand out orbits to other galaxies. 
5 change the logo



# talk about the stores
another thing about the stores is having stickers to guide people instead of unnessarily having to stop someone at work to guide them. they can be on the floors, on the walls too. 


# talk about people who understand what planet yogurt stands for...
i understand there are many who would like to be employed to this once it booms. especially the youth who are very idle and wanna make some kes. 
a part time job, sort of like shifts? just open to ideas.
